# Dockerized DOOM

This is my personal implementation of a docker container to run the game
[freedoom](https://freedoom.github.io). The primary purpose of this
project is to understand more about graphics and audio from within a
docker container. The secondary purpose is to learn to reduce the size of
the docker image by replacing things like the `ubuntu:20.04` with a much
smaller base image like `alpine`.
